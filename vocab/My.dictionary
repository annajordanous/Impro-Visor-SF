/* Diatonic Checking Information
 * In order to determine whether a chord is diatonic to a key, the analysis 
 * requires knowledge of two things: one, the equivalences between possible chord
 * qualities (such as M7 and M9) and two, the base chords which are diatonic to
 * the key of C for a given mode.
 * 
 * Equivalence rules have the format
 *     (equiv [basic chord] [equivalent chord] [equivalent chord] ...)
 * where the basic chord is one that might arise in the actual diatonic mapping of
 * a key below, and the equivalent chords are chords of the same root with 
 * different qualities.
 * 
 * Diatonic rules have the format
 *     (diatonic [mode] [list of all chords fitting the key of Cmode] )
 * with the mode generally being capitalized for formatting purposes in the 
 * leadsheet and roadmap modes.

/* Brick Definitions
 * A chord brick can be comprised of anything from a single chord to a series of
 * complex bricks. 
 * 
 * Each brick is defined by five things: its name (with any qualifier information 
 * needed), its mode, its type, its key, and the list of subblocks composing it. 
 * A brick definition thus has the following format:
 * 
 *     (defbrick [name-spaced-by-hyphens]([qualifier]) [mode] [type] [key]
 *             ([first subblock])
 *             ([second subblock])
 *             ...
 *             ([last subblock]))
 *
 *  Name: Each brick must have a name by which it can be identified in the 
 *        brick library. If a name has multiple words, then one may replace the
 *        spaces in the name with hyphens so as to keep the name in one unit.
 *        Additionally, if a user wishes to have multiple different brick 
 *        definitions for the same brick, she may add a qualifier to the name
 *        of each brick in parentheses directly after the name. Two bricks may
 *        have the same name, and will be treated as the same brick in parsing,
 *        but no two may have the same name-qualifier pair. The first definition
 *        of a brick with a given name will be taken as the default.
 *
 *  Mode: A brick generally has a single mode which describes the chord sequence
 *        it contains. Generally, this will either be "Major" or "Minor", based
 *        upon whether the brick has a "straight" or a "sad" feel or what the
 *        mode is of the "on" chords of the brick.
 *
 *  Type: A brick has a type based upon the purpose it serves; for instance, a 
 *        Cadence introduces a resolving musical idea. A given brick type must
 *        be listed at the top of the file in order to be treated as a valid
 *        type in the roadmap. Brick-type definitions are formatted as:
 *
 *            (brick-type [type name]  [cost])
 *
 *        where cost specifies how much it is favored in parsing. The larger the
 *        cost number, the less preferred a brick is as explanation for a series
 *        of chords when a piece is analyzed.
 *
 *        A special type, Invisible, accounts for bricks which will not be shown
 *        to the user in parsing but might help generalize pieces of complex
 *        bricks with many variations. If a brick is specified as "Invisible", 
 *        it will not be shown to the user at all in Impro-Visor, but any brick
 *        definition depending on the brick will still be able to function as
 *        it normally would.
 *
 *  Key:  The predominant key of the brick should be based upon where the brick
 *        does resolve, or in the case of an unresolved sequence where it would
 *        resolve after the sequence. Usually, the key specified in this library
 *        is C; however, this is not a prerequisite for a definition.
 *
 *  Sub-blocks: A "block" is either a brick or a chord; so, a "sub-block" is a 
 *        brick or chord that acts as part of a definition. These are listed 
 *        after the basic brick information in order of occurrence in the brick. 
 *        If a sub-block is a chord, then it is written as
 *            
 *            (chord [chord name] [relative duration])
 *
 *        whereas a brick sub-block would be listed as
 *
 *            (brick [brick name] [key] [relative duration])
 *        
 *        to appropriately describe the default version of that brick. If a sub-
 *        brick is supposed to be by default a variation on a given brick's
 *        definition rather than the original, then the quality can be specified
 *        in the definition as
 *            
 *            (brick [brick name]([qualifier]) [key] [relative duration])
 *
 *        to make the default in the dictionary appear with that variation as a
 *        sub-block. However, when parsing, the parser will treat all bricks 
 *        with the same name as substitutable for that brick, so this usage will
 *        not allow a brick to have a more specific definition in all cases.
 *
 *        Relative durations describe the ratio of the durations of each sub-
 *        block to the others in a given brick. These relative durations should
 *        have values no less than the number of chords composing a given sub-
 *        block. These are used only for the specification of bricks in the user
 *        library, as analysis ignores chord durations.
 *
 * With this information, a brick will be defined in the BrickLibrary and used in
 * analysis as a possible parse for a given brick. Bricks may be added either by
 * hand in this file or, more easily, by generating the brick in Impro-Visor's 
 * Roadmap mode, selecting it, and clicking the "New Brick" button. The definition
 * will then be added to the bottom of this file to be loaded in future Impro-Visor
 * use.
 *
 * If you introduce a Cadence into the brick dictionary, you will notice that 
 * matching Overrun and Dropback versions of the brick will also appear for that
 * brick on runtime. At the present, the only way to remove those bricks is to
 * remove the original cadence.
 * 
 * WARNING: Deleting a brick from the brick dictionary manually may destroy the
 * definitions of any bricks using the brick you wish to delete as a sub-block. In 
 * order to avoid damaging the dictionary, setting the brick type of a brick you
 * wish to ignore to "Invisible" will retain all dependent definitions without 
 * revealing the undesired brick at runtime.
 *
 * Stuff on lines beginning with two slashes or between slash star and star slash
 * are "commented out". They are not in effect, but may be revisited.
