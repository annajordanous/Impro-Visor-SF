Welcome to Impro-Visor (Improvisation Advisor) Version 4, from Bob Keller at Harvey Mudd College.

If you need help, please post to the Yahoo! impro-visor user group:

	groups.yahoo.com/impro-visor

Impro-Visor is free and runs on any platform that supports Java 1.5 or later, including:
 
    Windows (XP, 2000, or Vista)
    MacOSX (Tiger (10.4.3 or later) needed for Java 1.5)
    Linux 

Once you have Java 1.5 installed, you may run this program as follows:

    Copy directory improvisorNNN, where NNN is the version number, to your desktop.  

Then double-click 

    improvisor.jar

(You cannot start the application by clicking on individual leadsheet files.
They must be opened from within.)
 
You can download the latest version of Java free from:

           http://www.java.com/download/
 
What you want is the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).

I hope you enjoy using the program.


Bob Keller, Impro-Visor Project Director
