Impro-Visor project sources.

If doing GUI work of any kind, please use the Netbeans environment 6.5 or later.

A lot of the GUI Java code is auto-generated by Netbeans. 
If you modify that yourself, it will create many problems and make your source unusable later on.

If modifying using a text editor outside Netbeans, please familiarize yourself with Netbeans 
comment conventions for indicating generated code first.

Thanks.
